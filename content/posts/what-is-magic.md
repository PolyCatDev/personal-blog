Recently I watched [this amazing video](https://youtu.be/On9KHaBYzmo) and it got me thinking: What _is_ magic and why do some magic systems feel less magical than others?

The video explains it nicely but I still felt the need to put my thoughts down on paper.

Also I've found [this video](https://youtu.be/Jeb_mSOgrVg) that encapsulates my ideas really nicely if you wish more details.

## Magic in real life

From what I understand, magic in real life is a blanket term for something you believe in yet has no proof. It's magic because you believe it's true, not because it's proven.

For example: A magical amulet is magical as long as you personally believe it is. No one can truly verify that it's magic.

That's what magic is in real life, a belief.

## Magic in fantasy

Fantasy throws a wrench in this equation because there usually is proof. A fireball ether appears or it doesn't.

So now that proof exists, fantasy magic is no longer just a belief, it's more of a belief to science spectrum. The more rules you place on magic, the closer to science and farther away from belief it gets.

This balancing act is what I believe to be the purpose of the magic system is. That's why some feel less magical, they tend to be more on the science end of the spectrum.

## In conclusion

Magic in real life is not the same as magic in fantasy stories. Real life magic exists due to people's belief in it while fantasy magic is usually a mix of both belief and proof.

Magic systems are a way of trying to manage the belief to science spectrum in the way the author believes it's best for the story.
