# What I got

Some time ago I got my first phishing email and decided to document it.
Here's the email I received. I know, very convincing :33

# The Malware

Just your bog standard bot email. But attached to it was a little treat named `ENQ1825.txz`. So I went over to [tria.ge](https://tria.ge/), fired up a VM and got back a nice 10 out 10. That's some malware alright.

Apparently it's a [Trojan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing)), [Spyware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyware), [RAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_desktop_software#RAT) and an [Infostealer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer).

More specifically from the Formbook family and from what I could find on Malpedia it's mainly an [Infostealer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer).

For any of y'all interested in the details here's a big ass screenshot of the report:

# Conclusion

I got the usual spam mail and wanted to share what kind of malware I got.
